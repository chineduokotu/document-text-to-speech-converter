Welcome to the Text-to-Speech Automation Tool!

This is a sample text file that you can use to test the text-to-speech functionality. 

The tool supports various features:
- Multiple document formats including PDF, DOCX, PPTX, and plain text
- Customizable voice settings such as speech rate and volume
- Both command-line and graphical user interfaces
- Batch processing capabilities for multiple files
- Configuration management to save your preferences

You can use this file by running:
python main.py --file examples/sample.txt

Or load it through the GUI interface by clicking the Browse button and selecting this file.

This sample text contains enough content to demonstrate the chunked processing feature, which breaks long texts into smaller segments for better speech control and user experience.

Thank you for trying out the Text-to-Speech Automation Tool!
